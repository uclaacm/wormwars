Worm Wars
---

We are the AI@UCLA Gaming Group.

Worm Wars is an omnidirectional, competitive version of Snake. In a way it's a combination of Snake and Tron, where the objective is to be the first to grow to a certain size, while preventing your opponents from doing so before you.

Our first objective is to be able to write intelligent bots that can compete on equal footing with human players. Our second, of course, is to have fun!

Development

The game is being built using the Unity game engine.

1. Create a new project in Unity, call it "wormwars"
